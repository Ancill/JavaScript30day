      // ---------------------Array----------------------------

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;
      console.log(players, team);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = "Lux"; // => it is reference of players
      console.log(players, team);

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      // now here is the problem!
      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice(); // takes copy of original array
      team2[3] = "Sam";
      console.log(players, team2);

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      team3[3] = "Smerf";
      console.log(players, team3);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[3] = "Smile";
      console.log(players, team4);

      // with Objects

        age: 80,
        social: {

      };
      const person2 = person;
      person2.name = "Ivan";
      console.log(person, person2);

      // and think we make a copy:
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const captain = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 23 }); // shallow copy one level deep
      captain.name = "Max";

      const cap1 = { ...person };
      cap1.social.facebook = "AliluaFace";
      console.log(cap1, person);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
